Hello! This is a sample text. It contains multiple sentences to demonstrate text processing in Python. There are 30 sentences here, and the total word count exceeds 200 words.

You may notice some extra spaces   and some numbers like 123, 456, 7890. These should be removed during text cleaning. Also, punctuation marks like commas, periods, and exclamation marks should be stripped out. The goal is to clean and preprocess the text for further analysis.

Text cleaning involves removing unwanted characters, such as punctuation, special symbols, and numbers. Tokenization splits the text into individual words for easier analysis. Once tokenized, the stop words (common words like 'the', 'is', etc.) should be removed to focus on important terms.

After cleaning and tokenization, we will check for misspelled words and correct them if necessary. This step ensures that any typographical errors in the text are addressed. Misspelling correction is important for text consistency and accuracy.

By the end of this process, you should have a clean and processed version of the text, which can be used for various text analysis tasks, such as sentiment analysis, keyword extraction, or language modeling.

Keep in mind that different datasets may have varying types of noise and preprocessing requirements. However, these general steps are a great starting point for cleaning and preparing text data.
