Cloud computing delivers computing services over the Internet. These services include servers, storage, databases, networking, and software. Companies like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud dominate the market. Cloud computing offers scalability and flexibility. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS) are key models. Security and compliance are major concerns. Organizations must manage cloud costs effectively. Cloud migration involves moving data and applications to the cloud. Virtualization enables better resource utilization. Public cloud, private cloud, and hybrid cloud are common deployment models. Serverless computing allows developers to focus only on code. Edge computing processes data closer to the source. Backup and disaster recovery solutions are often cloud-based. Cloud-native applications are designed specifically for cloud environments. Auto-scaling allows systems to handle varying loads. Monitoring and logging tools are essential in cloud operations. Cloud computing supports big data analytics. Multi-cloud strategies use services from multiple providers. The future includes advances in quantum computing over the cloud.
