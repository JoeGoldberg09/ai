Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on building systems that learn from data. These systems improve their performance without being explicitly programmed. Supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning are the main types. Models like decision trees, support vector machines, and neural networks are widely used. Data preprocessing and feature selection are critical steps. Overfitting and underfitting are common challenges. Techniques like cross-validation help mitigate these issues. Hyperparameter tuning improves model performance. Machine learning is used in spam detection, recommendation systems, and medical diagnosis. Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, utilizes neural networks with many layers. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) excel in image processing tasks. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are great for sequential data. ML models need to be evaluated with metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall. Ethical considerations are important in ML deployment. Bias and fairness in machine learning models must be addressed. Automation through ML impacts industries globally. Continuous learning systems adapt over time. The field is evolving rapidly with new research. Machine learning relies heavily on quality data. Interpretability of models is crucial for trust.
