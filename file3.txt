Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that records transactions across many computers. It ensures security, transparency, and immutability. Bitcoin is the first and most popular application of blockchain. Blocks contain a cryptographic hash of the previous block, timestamp, and transaction data. Consensus algorithms like Proof of Work and Proof of Stake validate transactions. Smart contracts automatically execute agreements when conditions are met. Ethereum is a platform that enables smart contracts. Decentralization is a core principle of blockchain. Private blockchains are used within organizations for privacy. Public blockchains are open to anyone. Scalability is a major challenge. Layer-2 solutions aim to improve scalability. Blockchain technology enables tokenization of assets. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) represent unique digital items. Supply chain management benefits from blockchain transparency. Cryptographic techniques like hashing and digital signatures secure data. Governance in blockchain ecosystems varies across projects. Regulatory frameworks are evolving globally. Interoperability among blockchains is an emerging focus. Energy consumption of blockchain networks is a concern. Future developments include blockchain integration with IoT and AI.
